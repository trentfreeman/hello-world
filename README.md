I'm Trent, I go to Reed College and am working to get an undergrad degree in math/computer science. I'm using this as a place both to store classwork from various classes, and to put random projects I'm working on (a small game in GameMaker/some basics in JavaScript +more(?!?!?!?!)). I'll also put up some LaTeX documents of some homework assignments as an example of some of the more CS theory that I've been learning (complexity and cryptography stuff mostly).
